LogBlockWorldPruner
===================

Prunes Minecraft Regions that have no LogBlock history.  This script will separate out all of the regions that have a LogBlock history.  You can then replace your existing region folder with this new, much smaller region folder.  I do suggest keeping the original as a backup just in case something goes wrong.
